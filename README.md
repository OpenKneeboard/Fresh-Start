# OpenKneeboard Fresh Start

This is a tool to repair or remove OpenKneeboard.

It exists for a few reasons:

- Uninstallers should generally not remove your personal files or settings, only what was installed
- Microsoft imposes some limitations on MSI and MSIX installers and uninstallers that prevent a thorough uninstallation

**THIS TOOL IS CURRENTLY A PUBLIC BETA** - make a backup before using it.

## I've been using OpenKneebord for a while, and don't have any problems

## Where do I download this?

Download the exe file from [the latest release](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/Fresh-Start/releases/latest) on GitHub.

Run this tool in the default mode, which removes outdated components and repairs other components.

## I use OpenKneeboard, and that wasn't good enough

Run this tool with the 'remove everything' mode, but don't tell it to remove your settings. Then, reinstall the latest version of OpenKneeboard.

## I want to delete my settings too, and start fresh

Do the same but tick the 'delete settings' box ðŸ¤·
