# OpenKneeboard Fresh Start

This is a tool to repair or remove OpenKneeboard.

It exists for a few reasons:

- Uninstallers should generally not remove your personal files or settings, only what was installed
- Microsoft imposes some limitations on MSI and MSIX installers and uninstallers that prevent a thorough uninstallation
- CMake switched between per-machine and per-user installations. These are separate, so it was possible to have two versions 'installed' at the same time, causing conflicts
